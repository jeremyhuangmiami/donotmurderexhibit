      <h2>What Is This Commandment About?</h2>
      <p>The Biblical 6th Commandment, commonly known as "You shall not murder" (Exodus 20:13 or Deuteronomy 5:17), primarily addresses the unintentional and illegal killing of the innocent, pointing out the value of life since humans are made in God's image (Genesis 1:27); however, it does allow for killing in certain scenarios, e.g. self-defense, certain just wars, and capital punishment as per biblical law. Moreover, Jewish tradition draws a clear line between murder and death by accident or by law, while Jesus in the New Testament opened up the scope of Christ's in the Mount (Matthew 5:21-22) to include anger and hatred as root sins, thus making it a central ethical principle in the Judeo-Christian worldview.</p>

        <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> The word “murder” in the Bible’s original Hebrew language is <em>rātsach</em>, which means taking a life on purpose out of anger or hate.

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>The Sixth Commandment matters since it links the inherent worth of every life not only to the fact that people are created in God's image (Genesis 1:27) but also to the idea that killing is a crime against God as well as a crime against His image bearer; it supports the legal prohibition of murder in almost all cultures, it grants the weak protection against their oppressors, and it also has the effect of reducing vengeance and hatred (as Jesus taught in Matthew 5:21–22), and finally, it maintains the social order by stating that no one is allowed to take the life of another person without a just cause thereby creating room for peace, justice, and the restoration of the human and community relationship.</p>

      <h2>What Jesus Taught</h2>
      <p>Jesus instructed that the Sixth Commandment is a much more profound topic than simply killing. During the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5:21–22), He declared: 
‘You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, "You shall not murder, and anyone who commits murder will be judged." But I tell you that whoever is angry with his brother or sister will be judged. Besides, whoever says to his brother or sister, "Raca," will be liable to the Sanhedrin; and whoever says, "You fool!" will be in danger of the hell fire.’</p>
